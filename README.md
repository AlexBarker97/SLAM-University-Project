# Project LiDAR Mapping
The aim of the project was to explore a low-cost method of undergoing SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping) by creating a more expendable mobile search robot. Expensive LiDAR units are necessary for use in high speed, low risk applications such as cars. Although, within search and rescue the risk of damage is much higher and therefore lower cost options are more appropriate.
Specifically, the aim is to verify if a low cost, unidirectional infrared Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor mounted on a relatively cheap servo on top of a 4-wheeled robot, all controlled by a raspberry pi can undergo the complicated task of mapping a location whilst accounting for its own position within the map.
